# MicroLab 3D Printed Reactors

![Four Thieves Vinegar Micro Lab](https://github.com/FourThievesVinegar/microlab/blob/master/images/4tvc.jpg)

This repository contains STL files for the MicroLab 3D printed reactors. The software for the MicroLab reactor can be found here: https://github.com/FourThievesVinegar/solderless-microlab.

## Reactor Versions

### Version 5
The v5 folder contains updated parts files for the Microlab v0.5 release, it adds:
- A resized motor mount (measured in mm rather than cm - look out for this in other older parts!)
- A new flange for mounting the reaction chamber in its housing

### Version 4

The v4 folder contains the latest parts for the Microlab assembly, including:
- The main reactor manifold
- Lids for the heating and cooling setups
- Motor mount for the stirring motor
- Tubing adaptors
- And more! (Update me with precise file names and types)

### Version 3

The `VON_HIPPEL_REACTOR_v0.5/` directory contains STL files for the `v0.5` reactor: a three-piece 3D printed reactor which emphasizes using easy-to-find, off-the-shelf components.

The `VON_HIPPEL_REACTOR_v0.6/` directory contains STL files for the `v0.6` reactor: a single-piece 3D printed reactor which requires a much larger printed piece, but is without the need for other components.

Note that the hole dimensions in the `v0.5` and `v0.6` reactors are the same.

The design of the reactor is ongoing and future versions will be made available here as they are released.
