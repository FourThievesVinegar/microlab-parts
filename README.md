# MicroLab 3D Printed Reactors

![Four Thieves Vinegar Micro Lab](https://github.com/FourThievesVinegar/microlab/blob/master/images/4tvc.jpg)

This repository contains STL files for the MicroLab 3D printed reactors. The software for the MicroLab reactor can be found here: https://github.com/FourThievesVinegar/solderless-microlab.

## Reactor Versions

<IMG ALT="A fully-assembled v6 Microlab" SRC="https://github.com/FourThievesVinegar/solderless-microlab/blob/docs/release0.6-updates/docs/media/microlab-v0.6.0-assembled.jpg?raw=true" WIDTH="400" />

### Version 6

The v6 version includes parts for the Microlab v0.6 release.

- New printable Control Unit case
- New printable Pumps Unit case
- New printable Reactor Box
- New printable Reactor Stand (screw-together or slot-and-tab style)
- Redesigned Reactor Manifold that includes more ports and supports stock canning jar lid rings

### Version 5
The v5 folder contains updated parts files for the Microlab v0.5 release, it adds:
- A resized motor mount (measured in mm rather than cm - look out for this in other older parts!)
- A new flange for mounting the reaction chamber in its housing

### Version 4

The v4 folder contains ~~the latest~~ old parts for the Microlab assembly, including:

- The main reactor manifold
- Lids for the heating and cooling setups
- Motor mount for the stirring motor
- Tubing adaptors
- And more! (Update me with precise file names and types)

### Version 3

The `VON_HIPPEL_REACTOR_v0.5/` directory contains STL files for the `v0.5` reactor: a three-piece 3D printed reactor which emphasizes using easy-to-find, off-the-shelf components.

The `VON_HIPPEL_REACTOR_v0.6/` directory contains STL files for the `v0.6` reactor: a single-piece 3D printed reactor which requires a much larger printed piece, but is without the need for other components.

Note that the hole dimensions in the `v0.5` and `v0.6` reactors are the same.

The design of the reactor is ongoing and future versions will be made available here as they are released.
