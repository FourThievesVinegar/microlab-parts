# This is a PartCAD configuration file.
# See https://partcad.readthedocs.io/ for more information.

# This PartCAD package is intended to facilitate the development process
# and it's not intended to be added to the public PartCAD repository
# or to be used as a dependency in third-party projects.
# The public PartCAD package will be added to
# https://github.com/FourThievesVinegar/solderless-microlab/

# PartCAD does not currently support FreeCAD files as the source.
# Thus, for now, STEP files are used as the source files.
# The currently recommended ways to maintain sources in PartCAD are
# CadQuery, build123d and OpenSCAD.
# Once more git-friendly source files are available, both STEP and STL files
# will be automatically produced using the source files.

# Usage:
#   - To render output files, use 'pc render'.
