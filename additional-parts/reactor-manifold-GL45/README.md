# GL45 Variant Reactor Core

This experimental design uses a borosilicate media bottle with GL45 threads as the inner vessel and a hand-cut teflon disk as the lid to improve chemical compatibility. Because the sealing surface is the bottom of the teflon disk, not the edges, tight tolerances are not required.
